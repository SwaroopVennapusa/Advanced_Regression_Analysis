# Advanced_Regression_Analysis


## Course work
In this course, I deepened my understanding of a wide range of regression techniques. Starting with the basics of simple linear regression, I learned and implemented hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and explored the dynamics between predictors and response variables. I gained proficiency in multiple regression using matrix notation and tackled statistical challenges such as multicollinearity using methods like Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). The coursework also covered the incorporation of categorical variables through dummy coding, interaction effects to capture complex relationships, and polynomial regression for modeling non-linear trends. Advanced diagnostics and logistic regression were key components of the course, improving my skills in managing binary outcomes and evaluating the strength of models through detailed statistical testing.


## Final Project
The final project focuses on fuel economy analysis, involving preprocessing steps such as data cleaning and structuring for analysis. It utilizes US EPA data to evaluate fuel efficiency across different vehicle manufacturers. Using Python for data cleaning and R for statistical analysis, this project explores how vehicle characteristics like horsepower and weight influence fuel economy. Multiple linear regression models are employed to identify significant predictors and trends, supported by rigorous hypothesis testing to validate the results. Diagnostic checks are also conducted to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models. The aim is to provide insights into the factors that affect fuel efficiency, thereby informing both manufacturers and consumers about key aspects of vehicle performance.
