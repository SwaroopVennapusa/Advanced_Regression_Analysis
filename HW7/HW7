In a regression analysis of on-the-job head injuries of warehouse laborers caused by falling
objects, Y is a measure of severity of the injury, X1 is an index refiecting both the weight of
the object and the distance it fell, and X2 and X3 are indicator variables for nature of head
protection worn at the time of the accident, coded as follows:
Type of Protection         X2        X3
Hard hat 		    1 	       0
Bump cap		    0	       1
None			    0		0

The response function to be used in the study is E{Y}
= beta_0 + beta_1*X1 + beta_2*X2 + beta_3*X3
a. Develop the response function for each type of protection category.
b. For each of the following questions, specify the alternatives Ho and Ha for the appropriate
test: (I) With X1 fixed, does wearing a bump cap reduce the expected severity of injury as
compared with wearing no protection? (2) With X1 fixed, is the expected severity of injury
the same when wearing a hard hat as when wearing a bump cap?


Answer:

### Part a: Develop the response function for each type of protection category.

1. **Hard Hat**:
   - When a hard hat is worn, X2 = 1, and X3 = 0. The response function (i.e., the expected value of Y) is:
     - E(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1*X1 + beta_2*1 + beta_3*0
     - E(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1*X1 + beta_2

2. **Bump Cap**:
   - When a bump cap is worn, X2 = 0, and X3 = 1. The response function is:
     - E(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1*X1 + beta_2*0 + beta_3*1
     - E(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1*X1 + beta_3

3. **None** (No protection):
   - When no protection is worn, both X2 and X3 are 0. The response function is:
     - E(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1*X1 + beta_2*0 + beta_3*0
     - E(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1*X1

### Part b: Specify the null and alternative hypotheses.

#### Question 1:
"With X1 fixed, does wearing a bump cap reduce the expected severity of injury as compared with wearing no protection?"

For this question, we are comparing the "Bump cap" category (E(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1*X1 + beta_3) to the "None" category (E(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1*X1). Specifically, we are interested in whether beta_3 is negative, indicating a reduction in the expected severity.

- Ho (Null Hypothesis): beta_3 = 0 (Wearing a bump cap does not change the expected severity of injury compared with no protection.)
- Ha (Alternative Hypothesis): beta_3 < 0 (Wearing a bump cap reduces the expected severity of injury compared with no protection.)

#### Question 2:
"With X1 fixed, is the expected severity of injury the same when wearing a hard hat as when wearing a bump cap?"

Here, we are comparing the "Hard hat" category (E(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1*X1 + beta_2) to the "Bump cap" category (E(Y) = beta_0 + beta_1*X1 + beta_3). We want to know if the difference, represented by (beta_2 - beta_3), is zero.

- Ho (Null Hypothesis): beta_2 = beta_3 (The expected severity of injury is the same for both a hard hat and a bump cap.)
- Ha (Alternative Hypothesis): beta_2 â‰  beta_3 (The expected severity of injury is not the same for a hard hat and a bump cap.)
